;;Start inline completion
;; M-x semantic-complete-analyze-inline
;; This is a command that does completion inline (underlining the target symbol) and allows TAB to be used for completion purposes.

;; Automatically starting inline completion in idle time
;;   M-x global-semantic-idle-completions-mode
;; This is a minor mode which runs semantic-complete-analyze-inline-idle during idle time. Instead of trying to complete the symbol immediately, it will just display the possible completions, and underline the current symbol the cursor is on.

;; Starting for inline completion when "." is pressed
;;  (define-key your-mode-map-here "." 'semantic-complete-self-insert)
;; Binding semantic-complete-self-insert to a key will insert that key's text, as per self-insert-command, and then run the inline completion engine if there is appropriate context nearby.

;; Speedbar completion mode
;;   M-x semantic-speedbar-analysis
;; This will start Speedbar in a special mode. In this mode it will analyze the cursor location, and provide intelligent references. Unlike inline completion, a raw list of options is provided and you just need to click on the one you want. Sometimes you need to press g to force an update.
