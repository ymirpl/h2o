# Defintion (this defn. seems odd. for the case of real quantiles, it should be a  floor, not a round up?)
# This definition may be correct for 1-based indexing. (we do zero-based indexing in the code below, so it looks different)

# For a finite population of N values indexed 1,...,N from lowest to highest, 
# the kth q-quantile of this population can be computed via the value of I_p = N * k/q. 
# "25th quantile":
# If I_p is not an integer, then round up to the next integer to get the appropriate index; the corresponding data value is the kth q-quantile. 
# If I_p is an integer then any number from the data value at that index to the data value of the next can be taken as the quantile, 
# and it is conventional (though arbitrary) to take the average of those two values (see Estimating the quantiles).
# "0.25 quantile"
# If, instead of using integers k and q, the "p-quantile" is based on a real number p with 0<p<1, then p 
# replaces k/q in the above formulae. Some software programs (including Microsoft Excel) regard the minimum and 
# maximum as the 0th and 100th percentile, respectively; however, such terminology is an extension beyond traditional statistics definitions.


# Multipass Binning implementatoin

# might have multiple rows with that one number
# possible answers:
#   that number if single row  in that bin, 
#   that number if the threshold is fractional and 2 or more rows in that bin
#   if 1 row in the last bin, have to interpolate (mean), to the next sorted value 
#   this will be the min of the "outside the bin" 
#   (min of everthing to the right of the last bin)
# When doing the repeated binning, may have to "nudge" the computed
# bin edges, to make sure we don't lose the target row due to finite precision fp issues

# interesting tests
# set bin count to 1, and it should iterate forever, without resolving anything
# shouldn't lose anything from the bin due to edge leakage
# set bin count to 2, so

# continous distributions of data are the easy cases
# best test: pick a target value, than add data < and > it with the right percentages
# for your target threshold. Answer should be your target value, exactly.

# The interpolation cases are harder to generate the test case for.
# sometimes it's best to sort the list, and do the interpolation by hand, for generating
# the expected value

# memory is conserved by reusing the histogram each pass. histogram has per bin cnt/min/max
# some other bits of state are used per iteration, but not per bin.

# Can process multiple histograms with different binning goals, per data pass. 
# This does one (hcnt2) # histogram (could pass a list  of hcnt2s and associated state)

# each pass creates a best guess from the info available at that pass
# best_result[] list then shows the incremental improvement per pass
