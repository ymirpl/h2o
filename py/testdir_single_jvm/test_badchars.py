# we have this rule for NUL. This test is not really following the  rule (afte eol)
# so will say it's not a valid test.
# Since NUL (0x00) characters may be used for padding, NULs are allowed, 
# and ignored after any line end, until the first non-NUL character. 
# NUL is not a end of line character, though. 
# verify: NUL (0x00) can be used as a character in tokens, and not be ignored.
