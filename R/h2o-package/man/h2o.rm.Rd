\title{Removes H2O objects from the server where H2O is running.}
\description{Allows users to remove H2O objects from the server where the instance of H2O is running. This call acts on the H2O server through the R console, and does NOT remove the associated named object from the R environment. 
}
\usage{
h2o.rm(object, keys)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{An \code{\linkS4class{H2OClient}} object containing the IP address and port of the server running H2O.}
  \item{keys}{the hex key associated with the object to be removed.}
}
\note{Users may wish to remove an H2O object on the server that is associated with an object in the R environment. Recommended behavior is to also remove the object in the R environment. See the second example at the end of this section.}
