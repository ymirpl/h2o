DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

The .dat file gives the data for a part of a large clinical trial
carried out by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group in the United States. 
The full study included patients with squamous carcinoma of 15 sites in 
the mouth and throat, with 16 participating institutions, though only data 
on three sites in the oropharynx reported by the six largest institutions 
are considered here. Patients entering the study were randomly assigned to 
one of two treatment groups, radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy 
together with a chemotherapeutic agent.  One objective of the study was to 
compare the two treatment policies with respect to patient survival.

STORY BEHIND THE DATA:

Approximately 30% of the survival times are censored owing primarily to 
patients surviving to the time of analysis. Some patients were lost
to follow-up because the patient moved or transferred to an institution not
participating in the study, though these cases were relatively rare. From 
a statistical point of view, an important feature of these data is the 
considerable lack of homogeneity between individuals being studied. 
Of course, as part of the study design, certain criteria for patient 
eligibility had to be met which eliminated extremes in the extent of disease, 
but still many factors are not controlled.

This study included measurements of many covariates which would be expected 
to relate to survival experience. Six such variables are given in the data 
(sex, T staging, N staging, age, general condition, and grade).   The site 
of the primary tumor and possible differences between participating 
institutions require consideration as well.
     
The T,N staging classification gives a measure of the extent of the tumor at 
the primary site and at regional lymph nodes. T=1, refers to a small primary 
tumor, 2 centimeters or less in largest diameter, whereas T=4 is a massive 
tumor with extension to adjoining tissue. T=2 and T=3 refer to intermediate
cases. N=0 refers to there being no clinical evidence of a lymph node 
metastasis and N=1, N=2, N=3 indicate, in increasing magnitude, the extent of 
existing lymph node involvement. Patients with classifications T=1,N=0; 
T=1,N=1;  T=2,N=0; or T=2,N=1, or with distant metastases were excluded 
from study.

The variable general condition gives a measure of the functional capacity of 
the patient at the time of diagnosis (1 refers to no disability whereas
4 denotes bed confinement; 2 and 3 measure intermediate levels). The variable
grade is a measure of the degree of differentiation of the tumor (the degree
to which the tumor cell resembles the host cell) from 1 (well differentiated) 
to 3 (poorly differentiated)

In addition to the primary question whether the combined treatment mode is
preferable to the conventional radiation therapy, it is of considerable 
interest to determine the extent to which the several covariates relate to
subsequent survival.  It is also imperative in answering the primary question 
to adjust the survivals for possible imbalance that may be present in the 
study with regard to the other covariates. Such problems are similar to those 
encountered in the classical theory of linear regression and the analysis of 
covariance.  Again, the need to accommodate censoring is an important 
distinguishing point. In many situations it is also important to develop 
nonparametric and robust procedures since there is frequently little empirical
or theoretical work to support a particular family of failure time 
distributions.
