H2O is the open source math and prediction engine for Big Data Science.

The main two package groups are "water" and "hex".

The water package contains the implementation of H2O's core, including
the distributed key value store, parsing, and I/O.

The hex package conceptually layers on top of the water package, and
contains math and machine learning algorithms.
