H\ :sub:`2`\ O + R Console For Developers Using Git
------------------------------------------------------------------


These instructions assume you are using R  2.14.0 or later, and are a
developer who is using a local build of H\ :sub: `2`\ O from Github.
If the version in use is from available downloads at 
`http://0xdata.com/downloadtable <http://0xdata.com/downloadtable/>`_
please close these instructions and visit :ref:`Rfromdownload`

**STEP 1**

Obtain  H\ :sub:`2`\ O from Git. For instructions on getting started
from Github visit :ref:`QuickstartGit`


**STEP 2**

Start an instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O (in this example, on localhost
with 3 gigs of memory, and assuming you are in a local h2o directory).

::

  java -Xmx3g -jar target/h2o.jar

This should return output similar to the following: 

::

If users do not start an instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O, one will be
started automatically for them at localhost: 54321 (see **STEP 5** for
more detail). 

If the instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O is stopped, the R
program will no longer run, and work done will be lost. 

**STEP 3:** 

From your terminal at the top of your h2o directory: 

::

  open target/index.html

Which will open a browser based index page that looks similar to the
following:

.. image:: localbuildindex.png
   :width: 100 %  

**STEP 4:**

Cut and paste the instructions into the R concole or R Studio as shown
in the index page displayed when command in **STEP 3** is run. 
 
  

**STEP 5:**


If there is no running instance of  H\ :sub:`2`\ O prior to using
the command "h2o.init()",  H\ :sub:`2`\ O in R will start an instance
automatically for the user at localhost:54321, and the user will be
notified.  

Users who wish to specify a connection
with a server (other than localhost at port 54321) must explicity
state the IP address and port number in the h2o.init call. 
An example is given below, but **do not cut and paste**; users should
specify the IP and port number appropriate to their specific
environment. 

::

  library(h2o)
  localH2O = h2o.init(ip = "192.555.1.123", port = 12345, startH2O = FALSE)
