Introduction to H\ :sub:`2`\ O
==============================

H\ :sub:`2`\ O by 0xdata brings better algorithms to big data. H\ :sub:`2`\ O is the open
source math and machine learning platform for speed and scale. With
H\ :sub:`2`\ O, enterprises can use all of their data (instead of sampling) in
real-time for better predictions. Data Scientists can take both simple
and sophisticated models to production from H\ :sub:`2`\ Othe same interactive
platform used for modeling, within R and JSON. H\ :sub:`2`\ O is also used as an
algorithms library for Making Hadoop Do Math. Our earliest customers
have built powerful domain specific predictive engines for
Recommendations, Pricing and Outlier detection in Fraud and
Insurance.

0xdata is the maker of H\ :sub:`2`\ O and nurturing a grassroots movement of
math, systems and data science to herald the new wave of Discovery
with Big Data Science.
