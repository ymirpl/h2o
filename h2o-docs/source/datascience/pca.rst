Principal Components Analysis
===========================================

The H\ :sub:`2`\ O PCA algorithm is still in development. If you have
questions or comments please see our contact us document. 
H\ :sub:`2`\ O is an open source tool and welcomes user  
collaboration.


Defining a PCA Model
""""""""""""""""""""

 **Ignored Columns:**

   The set of columns in the specified data set that should me omitted
   from the PCA.  Selections are made by highlighting and selecting from
   the field, which populates when the data key is specified. In
   general PCA does not include categorical variables in
   analysis. Factors are treated as binomial columns, with an
   indicator for each factor level, less one reference level. 
   If a variable is a factor, but has been coded as a number (for
   instance, color has been coded so that Green = 1, Red = 2, and
   Yellow = 3), users should be sure that these variables are not
   selected before running PCA. Including these variables can
   adversely impact results, because PCA will not correctly interpret
   them. 

 **Max PC:** 

   An integer value indicating the maximum number of principal
   components to return. 

 **Tolerance:**

   A tuning parameter that allows the specification of a minimum level
   of variance accounted for. A tolerance set at X is a threshold for
   exclusion so that components with less than X times the standard
   deviation of the strongest predictive component are not included in
   results. For instance, for a tolerance of 2 if the standard
   deviation of the strongest predictor (the first component) is .39,
   than any subsequent component with standard deviation less than
   (2)(.39) = .78 will not be included in the analysis of principal 
   components. 

 **Standardize:** 

   Allows users to specify whether data should be transformed so that
   each column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 prior to
   carrying out PCA. Standardizing is strongly reccomended. 


Interpreting Results
""""""""""""""""""""

The results of PCA are presented as a table. An example of such a table
is given below. In the simplest conceptual terms, PCA can be viewed as
an algorithm that takes a given set of old variables, and performs
transformations to yield a new set of variables. The new set of
variables have useful practical application, as well as many desirable
behaviors for further modeling. 

 **Std dev**

   *Standard deviation.* This is the standard deviation of the component
   defined in that column. In the example shown below the standard
   deviation of component PC0 is given as 2.5999. 

 **Prop Var**

  *Proportion of variance.* This value signifies the proportion of
   variance in the overall data set accounted for by the component. In
   the example shown below the proportion of variance accounted for by
   PC0 is 76.5%. 

 **Cum Prop Var**

   *Cumulative proportion of variance.*  This value signifies the
   cumulative proportion accounted for by the set of principal
   components in descending order of contribution. For instance, in the
   example below the two strongest components are PC0 and PC1. PC0
   accounts for about 76% of the variance in the dataset alone, while
   PC1 alone accounts for about 10% of variance. Together the two
   components account for 86% of variance; the value given in the **Cum
   Prop Var** field of the PC1 column. 

 **Variable Rows**
   
   In the PCA results table the factors included in the composition of
   principal components are listed, and their contribution to the
   component is given (called factor loadings). Note that if the
   contributions are summed by the column, the absolute value of each
   of the factor loadings sum to the total variance of the principal 
   component. 


 **Scree and Variance Plots**

  The scree and variance plots are visual tools that indicate the
  marginal contributions of each next principal component vector. The
  scree plot show the amount of variance accounted for by the first
  component, and then the additional variance accounted for by each of
  the next components, and approaches a minimum of zero contribution . 
  The variance plot shows the cumulative variance accounted for by
  each of the components, and approaches a maximum value of 1.

Notes on the application of PCA
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

H\ :sub:`2`\ O's PCA algorithm relies on a variance covariance matrix, not a
correlation coefficient matrix. Covariance and correlation are
related, but not equivalent. Specifically, the correlation between two
variables is their normalized covariance. For this reason, it's
recommended that users standardize data before running a PCA analysis. 

Additionally, modeling is driven by the simple assumption that set of
derived variables can be appropriately characterized by a linear
combination. PCA generates a set of new variables composed of
combinations of the original variables. The variance explained by PCA
is the covariance observed in the whole set of variables. If the
objective of a PCA analysis is to use the new variables generated to
predict an outcome of interest, that outcome must not be included in
the PCA analysis. Otherwise, when the new variables are used to
generate a model, the dependent variable will occur on both sides of
the predictive equation. 

PCA Algorithm
---------------

Let :math:`X` be an :math:`M\times N` matrix where
 
1. Each row corresponds to the set of all measurements on a particular 
   attribute, and 

2. Each column corresponds to a set of measurements from a given
   observation or trial

The covariance matrix :math:`C_{x}` is

:math:`C_{x}=\frac{1}{n}XX^{T}`

where :math:`n` is the number of observations. 

:math:`C_{x}` is a square, symmetric :math:`m\times m` matrix, the diagonal entries of which are the variances of attributes, and the off diagonal entries are covariances between attributes. 

The objective of PCA is to maximize variance while minimizing covariance. 

To accomplish this suppose a new matrix :math:`C_{y}` with off diagonal entries of 0, and each successive dimension of Y ranked according to variance. 

PCA finds an orthonormal matrix :math:`P` such that :math:`Y=PX` constrained by the requirement that 
 
:math:`C_{y}=\frac{1}{n}YY^{T}` 

be a diagonal matrix. 

The rows of :math:`P` are the principal components of X.

:math:`C_{y}=\frac{1}{n}YY^{T}`

:math:`=\frac{1}{n}(PX)(PX)^{T}`

:math:`C_{y}=PC_{x}P^{T}`. 

Because any symmetric matrix is diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix of its eigenvectors, solve matrix :math:`P` to be a matrix where each row is an eigenvector of 
:math:`\frac{1}{n}XX^{T}=C_{x}`

Then the principal components of :math:`X` are the eigenvectors of :math:`C_{x}`, and the :math:`i^{th}` diagonal value of :math:`C_{y}` is the variance of :math:`X` along :math:`p_{i}`. 

Eigenvectors of :math:`C_{x}` are found by first finding the eigenvalues 
:math:`\lambda` of :math:`C_{x}`.

For each eigenvalue :math:`lambda` 
:math:`(C-{x}-\lambda I)x =0` where :math:`x` is the eigenvector associated with :math:`\lambda`. 

Solve for :math:`x` by Gaussian elimination.
