Prior publications and useful reading relevant to analysis in general
and for each algorithm can be found in the references listed below. 

Understanding the algorithms of  H\ :sub:`2`\ O is an integral part of using the
platform correctly, and getting the most of analysis. 

Below are the citations of seminal articles, and articles
demonstrating rigorous application of the algorithms of H\ :sub:`2`\ O
This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to provide an
abbreviated syllabus to help develop a strong understanding.
