Gradient Boosted Regression and Classification
----------------------------------------------
Gradient boosted regression and gradient boosted classification are
forward learning ensemble methods. The guiding principal is that good
predictive results can be obtained through increasingly refined approximations. 

Defining a GBM Model
""""""""""""""""""""

**Destination Key:**

  A user defined name for the model. 

**Source**

  The .hex key associated with the parsed data to be used in the model.

**Response**

  The response variable.

**Ignored Columns**

  By default all of the information submitted in a data set will be
  used in building the GBM model. Users specify those attributes
  that should be omitted from analysis by highlighting them. 

**Classification**

  A tic-box option that, when checked, treats the outcome variable as
  categorical, and when unchecked treats the outcome variable as
  continuous. If a continuious real variable has been defined for the
  Response, H\ :sub:`2`\ O will return an error if a classificaiton model is
  requested. 

**Validation** 

  A .hex key associated with data to be used in validation of the
  model built using the data specified in **Source**.

**NTrees**

  The number of trees to be built. Models with different total numbers
  of trees can be specified by entering the different values as a
  comma separated list. For example,to specify diffrent models with
  200, 100 and 50 trees respectivly enter "200, 100, 50".

**Validation**

  A holdout data set against which the generated
  model (or models) will be tested.  

**Max Depth** 

  The maximum number of edges to be generated between the first node
  and the terminal node. To test different depths, values can be
  specified in a comma separated list.  

**Min Rows** 

  The minimum number of observations to be included in a terminal
  leaf. If any classification must consist of no fewer than five
  elements, min rows should be set to five. 

**NBins**

  The number of bins data are partitioned into before the best split
  point is determined. A high number of bins relative to a low number
  of observations will have a small number of observations in each
  bin. As the number of bins approaches the number of unique values in
  a column, the analysis approaches evaluation of all possible split
  points 

**Score Each Iteration** 

  An option that returns error rate information after each tree in the
  requested set is built. This option allows users to evaluate the
  marginal gain in fit from building that tree, allowing for
  interruption of the model when the gain for building the next tree isn't
  substantial enough to continue building. Users should be aware that
  this option can slow the model building process, depending on the
  size and shape of both the training data and the testing data. 

**Learn Rate**

  A number between 0 and 1 that specifies the rate at which the
  algorithm should converge. Learning rate is inversely related to the
  number of iterations taken for the algorithm to complete. 

**Grid Parallelism** 

  When multiple models are called for through the grid search options
  such as specification of multiple learning rates, selecting this
  option will build the set of models in paralell rather than
  sequentially.

**Treatment of Factors**

  When the specified GBM model includes factors, those factors are
  analyzed by assigning each distinct factor level an integer, and
  then binning the ordered integers according to the user specified
  number of bins (N Bins). Split points are determined by considering
  as the end points of each bin, and the one versus many split for
  each bin. 

  For example, if the factor is split into 5 bins, H2O orders the bins by 
  bin number, and then the split between the first and second bin, the
  second and third, the third and fourth, and the fourth and fifth are 
  considered. Additionally the split that comes of splitting the first
  bin from the other four, and all analogous splits for the other four
  bins are considered. If users wish to specify a model such that all
  factors are considered individually, they can do so by setting N
  Bins equal to the number of factor levels. This can be done even in
  excess of 1024 levels (the maximum number of levels that can be
  handled in R), though this will increase the time it takes for a
  model to be fully generated. 

Interpreting Results
"""""""""""""""""""""

GBM results for classification models are comprised of a confusion
matrix and the mean squared error of each tree. Note that when MSE for 
each tree is returned, the first and second MSE values are the same. 
The initial MSE is calculated for the dependent variable, and is given 
as a baseline against which to evaluate the predictive performance of 
each next basis function. The first MSE value given is the MSE for the 
data set before any trees are built. 

An example of a confusion matrix is given below:

The highlighted fields across the diagonal indicate the number the
number of true members of the class who were correctly predicted as
true. The overall error rate is shown in the bottom right field. It reflects
the proportion of incorrect predictions overall.

**MSE**

  Mean squared error is an indicator of goodness of fit. It measures
  the squared distance between an estimator and the estimated parameter. 

**Cost of Computation**

  The cost of computation in GBM is bounded above in the following way:

  :math:`Cost = bins\times (2^{leaves}) \times columns \times classes`



GBM Algorithm
""""""""""""""

H\ :sub:`2`\ O's Gradient Boosting Algorithms follow the algorithm specified by Hastie et
al (2001):


Initialize :math:`f_{k0} = 0,\: k=1,2,…,K`

:math:`For\:m=1\:to\:M:`
	:math:`(a)\:Set\:`
	:math:`p_{k}(x)=\frac{e^{f_{k}(x)}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K}e^{f_{l}(x)}},\:k=1,2,…,K`


	:math:`(b)\:For\:k=1\:to\:K:`

	:math:`\:i.\:Compute\:r_{ikm}=y_{ik}-p_{k}(x_{i}),\:i=1,2,…,N.`

	:math:`\:ii.\:Fit\:a\:regression\:tree\:to\:the\:targets\:r_{ikm},\:i=1,2,…,N`
	
	:math:`giving\:terminal\:regions\:R_{jim},\:j=1,2,…,J_{m}.`

	:math:`\:iii.\:Compute`

		:math:`\gamma_{jkm}=\frac{K-1}{K}\:\frac{\sum_{x_{i}\in R_{jkm}}(r_{ikm})}{\sum_{x_{i}\in R_{jkm}}|r_{ikm}|(1-|r_{ikm})},\:j=1,2,…,J_{m}.`

	:math:`\:iv.\:Update\:f_{km}(x)=f_{k,m-1}(x)+\sum_{j=1}^{J_{m}}\gamma_{jkm}I(x\in\:R_{jkm}).`
	      

Output :math:`\:\hat{f_{k}}(x)=f_{kM}(x),\:k=1,2,…,K.` 

**BETA: Standalone Scoring:**

  As a beta feature still undergoing testing, GBM models now offer
  users an option to download a generated GBM model in java code. This
  new feature can be accessed by clicking **Java Model** in the upper
  right corner. When the model is small enough, the java code for the
  model will be made available to inspect from within the GUI, larger
  models can be inspected after users have downloaded the model. 

  To download the model open the terminal window, create a directory
  where the model will be saved, set the new directory as the working
  directory and follow the curl and java compile commands displayed in
  the instructions at the top of the java model.
