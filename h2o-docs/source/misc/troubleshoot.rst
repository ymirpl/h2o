**Step 2** 

  From your email account contact h2ostream@googlegroups.com with a
  brief description of the error you encountered, and your contact
  information. Attach the downloaded H\ :sub:`2`\ O logs downloaded
  from log view to the email before sending. 

**Step 3**  

  We will route your email to the correct engineer or data scientist
  and work to resolve your issue. 



Other Common Troubleshooting Topics
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Common Question: Why is "Upload" is no longer working?**


This can occur when a userâ€™s local disk is full or almost full. 
Free up space on your local disk, and the behavior should resolve. 


**Common Question: How Do I Manage Dependencies in R?"**
  
  The  H\ :sub:`2`\ O R package utilizes other R packages
  (like lattice, and curl). From time to time R will fail to download
  from CRAN and give an error. In that case it's best to get the
  binary from CRAN directly and install the package manually using the call:

:: 

  >install.packages("path/to/fpc/binary/file", repos = NULL, type = "binary")

**R and H2O** 

  In order for H\ :sub:`2`\ O and R to work together, an instance of
  H\ :sub:`2`\ O must be running, and that instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O
  must be specified in the R workspace. If the H\ :sub:`2`\ O instance
  is terminated the H\ :sub:`2`\ O package in R will no longer work
  because R will no longer be able to send information to 
  H\ :sub:`2`\ O's distributed analysis, and will no longer be able to
  get info mation back. Even if a new instance of H\ :sub:`2`\ O is
  started with the exact same IP and port number, users
  will need to reestablish the connection between  H\:sub:`2`\ O and R
  using the call h2o.init(), and will have
  to restart their H\:sub:`2`\ O work session. 


**Updating the R Package**

  H\ :sub:`2`\ O's R package is headed for CRAN, but aren't there yet, and
  until recently, they were still "in . Follow the instructions in our R user
  documentation to install h2o in R (even if it is already
  installed), in order to ensure that you have the most recent
  version. If your issue persists, please let us know. 

**Internal Server Error in R**
   

::
  
  brew install gnu-tar
  cd /usr/bin
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin/tar gnutar

H2O On Windows
"""""""""""""""

**Using CMD Shell** as an alternative to using terminal for windows
users allows windows users to execute instructions as written for
installign and running H\ :sub: `2`\ O in general. 

In order to install and run R on Windows 8 (any and all R packages,
including those distributed by H\ :sub: `2`\ O) users will need read 
and write persmissions to   



Tunneling between servers with H\ :sub:`2`\ O
---------------------------------------------

**Step 1** 

Log in to the machine where H\ :sub:`2`\ O will run using ssh

**Step 2**

Start an instance of H\ :sub:`2` \O by locating the working directory and 
calling a java command similar to the following ( the port number chosen here
is arbitrary and users might choose something different). 
::

 $ java -jar h2o.jar -port  55599

This returns output similar to the following: 

::

 irene@mr-0x3:~/target$ java -jar h2o.jar -port 55599
 04:48:58.053 main      INFO WATER: ----- H2O started -----

 04:48:58.247 main      INFO WATER: Log dir: '/tmp/h2ologs'

**Step 3** 

Log into the remote machine where the running instance of H\ :sub:`2` \O will be
forwarded using a command similar to the following (where users
specified port numbers and IP address will be different)

::

  ssh -L 55577:localhost:55599 irene@192.168.1.173

**Step 4**

Check cluster status

You are now using H\ :sub:`2` \O from localhost:55577, but the
instance of H\ :sub:`2` \O is running on the remote server (in this
case the server with the ip address 192.168.1.xxx) at port number 55599. 

To see this in action note that the web UI is pointed at
localhost:55577, but that the cluster status shows the cluster running
on 192.168.1.173:55599
