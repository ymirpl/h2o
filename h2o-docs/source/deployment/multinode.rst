H\ :sub:`2`\ O on a Multi-Node Cluster
=======================================

The purpose of this walk-through is to show users how to set up 
an H\ :sub:`2`\ O multi-node cluster. Begin by locating a set of hosts to make up our cluster (a host could be a server, an EC2 instance, or your laptop.)


**STEP 1**

To download H\ :sub:`2`\ O, including the .jar, go to
the H\ :sub:`2`\ O `downloads page <http://0xdata.com/downloadtable/>`_ and choose the version that is right for your environment. 


**STEP 2**

Make sure the same h2o.jar file is available on every host.


**STEP 3**

The best way to get multiple H\ :sub:`2`\ O nodes to find each other is to
provide a flat file which lists the set of nodes.

Create a flatfile.txt with the IP and port for each H\ :sub:`2`\ O instance.
Put one entry per line.  For example:

::
 
  192.168.1.163:54321
  192.168.1.164:54321

(Note that the -flatfile option tells one H\ :sub:`2`\ O node where to find the
others.  It is not a substitute for the -ip and -port specification.)


**STEP 4**

Copy the flatfile.txt to each node in your cluster.


**STEP 5**


The Xmx option in the java command line specifies the amount of memory
allocated to one H\ :sub:`2`\ O node.  The cluster's memory capacity is the sum
across all H\ :sub:`2`\ O nodes in the cluster.

For example, if a user creates a cluster with four 20g nodes (by
specifying Xmx20g), H\ :sub:`2`\ O will have available a total of 80 gigs of
memory.

For best performance, we recommend you size your cluster to be about
four times the size of your data (but to avoid swapping, Xmx must not
be larger than physical memory on any given node).  Giving all nodes
the same amount of memory is strongly recommended (H\ :sub:`2`\ O
works best withsymmetric nodes).

Note the optional -ip (not shown in the example below) and -port
options tell this H\ :sub:`2`\ O node what IP address and ports (port and port+1
are used) to bind to.  The -ip option is especially helpful for hosts
that have multiple network interfaces.

::

  $ java -Xmx20g -jar h2o.jar -flatfile flatfile.txt -port 54321

You will see output similar to the following:

::

As you add more nodes to your cluster, the H\ :sub:`2`\ O output will inform you:

::

  INFO WATER: Cloud of size 2 formed [/...]...


**STEP 6**

Access the H\ :sub:`2`\ O Web UI with your browser.  Point your browser to the HTTP link given by **"Listening for HTTP and REST traffic on..."** in the H\ :sub:`2`\ O output.


**STEP 7**

If you are programmatically creating the cloud, you should give the
cloud some time to establish itself (typically one minute is
sufficient) and then check to see if the cloud is up.

To do this, point to the url http://<ip>:<port>/Cloud.json (see a
piece of the JSON response below).  Wait for the "cloud_size" to be
the expected value and the "consensus" field to be true.

::

  {
    ...
  
    "cloud_size": 2,
    "consensus": true,
  
    ...
  }
