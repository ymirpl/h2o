H\ :sub:`2`\ O on EC2
=====================

The H\ :sub:`2`\ O platform is regression tested nightly in EC2
for both single-node and multi-node configurations.

For people that want to quickly give it a try, we provide an AMI that
you can start from.

The README.txt file embedded below describes scripts that can be found
in the EC2 directory of the downloadable zip file, or in the EC2
directory of the github repository.
