Getting Started from a Downloaded Zip File
-------------------------------------------
 

Quick Step-by-step
""""""""""""""""""
1. Download the latest release of H\ :sub:`2`\ O as a .zip file from
   H\ :sub:`2`\ O `downloads page <http://0xdata.com/downloadtable//>`_.

2. From your terminal change your working directory to the same directory where your .zip file is saved.

3. From your terminal, unzip the .zip file.  For example:

::

  unzip h2o-1.7.0.520.zip

4. At the prompt enter the following commands. Choose a unique name (use the -name option) for yourself if other people might be running H\ :sub:`2`\ O in your network.

::

  cd h2o-1.7.0.520  #change working directory to the downloaded file
  java -Xmx1g -jar h2o.jar 

5. Wait a few moments and output similar to the following will appear in your terminal window:

::

  Irenes-MacBook-Pro:target Irene$ java -Xmx3g -jar h2o.jar

Useful Notes
""""""""""""   

First time users may need to download and install Java
in order to run H\ :sub:`2`\ O. The program is available free on the web, 
and can be quickly installed. Even though you will use Java to 
run H\ :sub:`2`\ O, no programming is necessary. 

In the Java command entered the term -Xmx1g was used. Xmx is the
amount of memory given to H\ :sub:`2`\ O.  If your data set is large,
give H\ :sub:`2`\ O more memory (for example, -Xmx4g gives H\ :sub:`2`\ O four gigabytes of
memory).  For best performance, Xmx should be 4x the size of your
data, but never more than the total amount of memory on your
computer.
